The answer lies in SPI - Stateful Packet Inspection. This is how a router keeps track of where to send a response on its subnet. I don't know all the nitty-gritty myself (I have never needed to know), but if you follow up the link you will find as much as you probably need to know. If not, a search on "Stateful Packet Inspection" will fill any gaps.
When the packet is received by the router, it looks at the port number and matches and sends to the computer/user.
The router assigns a random unused port number and keeps a table of who the port number refers to (the user's computer).
But now, how does the web server manage to send the request back to the local machine? Didn't the request come from an IP address on a local subnet? Where did it pick up the IP address of the local machine's router? And even if it has that router's IP, how does the packet get routed to the local machine once it gets to the router?
So, a user makes a HTTP request to some address. That request comes from an address on a local subnet, but the router knows to send the request to its default gateway because the destination IP doesn't match anything else in its routing table. The request hops through the internet and is eventually received by the destination machine (a web server). That all makes sense.
This is especially needed in a NAT environment (where the internal IPs are private and external IP is constant - like sharing the internet connection).
