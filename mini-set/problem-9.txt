Can I allocate more RAM or CPUs to the guest VMs (overcommit) without causing problems or is that just not worth it?
I am putting together a dual-xeon quad core (i.e., 8 cores total) 12GB RAM linux server to replace several old smaller servers. I would like to use virtualization both to learn about it and because the individuals who were using the old servers need to be kept separated.
I believe I will use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with KVM as the host system and Ubuntu 10.04 for the primary resource-intensive guest VM. The three additional guest VMs will probably be Debian Lenny and are low usage and low priority.
How should I partition the disks in order to most easily tell the host system where to put the various guest VMs? That is, I want the primary VM to take advantage of the faster SSD drives for its core/OS files, and use the SATA drives for its storage, and want the less important VMs to just use a portion of the SATA drives and stay off the SSDs.
The primary guest VM is the most-used server and it needs fast disk I/O, rebuilds a roughly 30GB MySQL database frequently, needs a lot of file storage space, runs Apache and a mail server. This entire hardware purchase is wasted if this server isn't performing well.
