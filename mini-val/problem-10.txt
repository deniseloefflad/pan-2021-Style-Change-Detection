So, there was change in data storage format starting in MySQL 5.6.4 in terms of looking at 5 bytes + an unknown number of bytes for microseconds (WEIRD) !!!
I ran into situation where I was setting up replication from MySQL 5.5 to 5.6 and replication would break because 5.6  wasexpecting microseconds in the relay log for DATETIME, tried to unpack the DATETIME and found out it was not the right length as 5.5 did not have microseconds (This was originally discovered by my manager then). The workaround was to switch to STATEMENT replication.
If the source data on the running MySQL 5.7.14 instance came from an older version of MySQL as a result of doing inplace upgrades, then I can see this happening if MySQL 5.7.22 stores DATETIME different between minor 5.7 releases.
I am just speculating at this point, but if the internals for DATETIME changed for 5.7 and it was not published, SHAME ON YOUR, ORACLE !!!. I am just kidding. What you should do from here is research if this bug was reported already. If not, you must report this one and let Oracle have some fun with it (They have missed a patch or overlooked microseconds somewhere).
